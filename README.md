- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript and react
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the things I interact with daily and love to use
- 📫 How to reach me ...(I like to be left alone)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I do not know how to hold a pen properly(according to the Indian way) and struggle to write as an adult.
